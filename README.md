# Draconis

Early stages of a simple, web based, old school RPG.

The current design choices and objectives for the first major version are:
- No install, but playable with a web browser
- Single player, no backend
- Not text based per se, but textual look and feel
- No world to explore but city hubs, dungeons and quests
- Party based with 6 characters of various classes
- Class specific active and passive skills
- Party classes use either technics points (refilled before each or combat) or mana (not refilled)
- Turn based and slightly tactical (i.e. party and enemies use rows) combats
- Generated loot
- Some crafting
- Misc (consumables such as potions, combat statuses, etc)
