# Draconis

Early stages of a simple, web based, old school RPG.

This project is also a sandbox to keep working on frontend technologies such as:
Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind, CSS animations, SVG, etc.

## Main design choices

The current design choices and objectives are:

- No install, but playable with a web browser
- Single player, no backend
- Not text based per se, but textual look and feel with some icons
- No world to explore but city hubs, dungeons and quests
- Party based with 4 characters of different classes
- Class specific active and passive skills
- Character classes use one of two type of energy point (tech vs mana) with different generation mechanisms
- Turn based and slightly tactical (i.e. party and enemies use rows) combats
- Generated loot
- Some crafting
- Misc (consumables such as potions, combat statuses, etc)

## Roadmap

Indicative roadmap:

- Combat system (turns, actions, rows, skills, statuses, enemies A.I., etc)
- Progression system (classes, skills, attributes, levels, etc)
- Equipment (slots, rarities, affixes, etc)
- Dungeons and monsters
- Cities
- Quests
- Crafting
