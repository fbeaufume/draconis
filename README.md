# Draconis

Early stages of a simple, web based, old school RPG.

This project is also a sandbox to keep working on frontend technologies such as:
Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind, CSS animations, SVG, etc. 

The current design choices and objectives for the first major version are:

- No install, but playable with a web browser
- Single player, no backend
- Not text based per se, but textual look and feel
- No world to explore but city hubs, dungeons and quests
- Party based with 6 characters of various classes
- Class specific active and passive skills
- Party classes use either technics points (refilled before each or combat) or mana (not refilled)
- Turn based and slightly tactical (i.e. party and enemies use rows) combats
- Generated loot
- Some crafting
- Misc (consumables such as potions, combat statuses, etc)

Indicative roadmap:

- Combat system (turns, actions, rows, area of effect, statuses, etc)
- Progression system (classes, skills, attributes, levels, etc)
- Equipment (slots, rarities, affixes, etc)
- Dungeons and monsters
- Cities
- Quests
- Crafting
